# The Vim Master Guide
4 steps to becoming a Vim/Vi master

# Step 0: 
Learn to touch type. Seriously - if your fingers don't know where the keys are then vim is going to be a pain. And even if you reject vim, touch typing will improve your programming (ask Steve Yegge ) by making the mind to monitor link friction free. There is a lot of software that can help you improve your typing.

# Step 1: 
Use vimtutor to get you started. It is in gvim (under the help menu I think) or you can just type 'vimtutor' at the command line. It will take 30-45 minutes of your time and then your fingers will know the basics of vi/vim and you should be able to edit files without wanting to hurl your keyboard out of the window.

# Step 2: 
Use vim everywhere. See this question for tips and links for using vim and vi key bindings at the command line, from your web browser, for composing emails, in your IDE ... You need to use vim to embed the key bindings in your muscle memory.

Search for Vim addons for your web browser

# Step 3: 
Learn more about vim. You will only have scratched the surface with vimtutor. You can read about tips and tricks on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=vim+tips) . You can browse vimtips. Learn a litle often would be my advice - there is so much out there that sticking to bite-size chunks will be the best way to make the knowledge stick.

# Step 4: 
Flex and Profit :)
